<h2>How to use KWIC search:</h2>
<h3>About KWIC search:</h3>
KWIC search is a Key Word In Context search program, in which you identify the website,
file, or wikipedia article you would like to search, and the keyword (search term) you
would like to look for. <br/> Please indicate if you are looking at a website, file, or
wikipedia article.<br/>
In the left-hand box you will see the all the sentences in which the keyword occurs,
and the keyword will be displayed in bold.<br/>
Once you select a sentence, the table on the right-hand side will display the form, lemma,
and POS tag of each word in the sentence.
<p>
<h3>URL/Filename:</h3>
This field should contain the URL/Filename/Wikipedia term you would like to search for.<br/>
<b>URL:</b>
The URL you want to search, including http:// or https:// <br/>
e.g. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/tooltip.html<br/>
<b>File:</b>
The file you want to search, including the whole path to find it on your computer.<br/>
e.g. C:\Users\User1\Corpus\AECorpus.txt<br/>
<b>Wiki:</b>
Enter the name of a wikipedia article you would like to search for; if multiple options
are possible, a box will pop up with possible articles to choose from.
Keep in mind: searching on wikipedia is case-senstive.<br/>
e.g. Berlin<br/>
If "German" is selected as the language, German Wikipedia will be searched.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Search  term:</h3>
This field should contain the word you would like to search for.<br/>
(e.g. see)<br/>
Keep in mind: The search is case-sensitive.
</p>
<p>
<h3>POS:</h3>
Select a POS tag if you would like to search for a keyword with a specific POS tag.<br/>
If the POS tag box is left blank, the program will search for all instances of the keyword.
e.g. if you search for "see" with POS tag VB, it will only return instances in which
"see" is the base form of the verb.<br/>
If you search for "see" without a POS tag, it will return all instances of "see".<br/>
To see what the different POS tags mean, look at the "POS tag meanings" tab.
</p>
<p>
<h3>N-grams:</h3>
The number of context words (words on either side of the keyword) you would like to
be displayed.<br/>
The default n-gram is the whole sentence, so the whole sentence will be displayed.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Search button:</h3>
To search for the keyword (optionally with a specific POS tag) in the given URL/File,
press the search button.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Language options:</h3>
KWIC search works in both English and German, but is in English as a default.<br/>
When German is selected, German OpenNLP tools are used, so the search term, POS tags,
lemmas, etc. will be displayed as their German equivalents.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Statistics button:</h3>
Once a search has been completed, you can click the "statistics" button to find out:<br/>
how many instances of the keyword occur in the text<br/>
how many sentences the keyword is in<br/>
the distribution of the word over the POS tags it has<br/>
the time it took to complete the search
</p>
<p>
	<h3>Save button:</h3>
Pressing this button prompts the user for a filename, in which to save the results<br/>
of the search. <br/>
If you attempt to save before you conduct a search, the program will show an error message.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Clear all button:</h3>
Pressing this button will clear all search boxes, results, tags, and reset the POS
and N-gram boxes.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Help button:</h3>
Pressing this button will show the help pages for the program, including how to use
the program, and the meanings of the POS tags.
